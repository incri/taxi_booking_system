    • Select the critical feature of the system and discribe them using as these of the following techniques.

→ USECASE DIAGRAM (including at least 2 level of discription of system feature)
→ ACTIVITY DIAGRAM 
→ CLASS DIAGRAM


    • Prior the implementation you should develop algorithm for the system . The algorith can be presented either visually or I text format

→ Flow of the development process should be shown through visual or text formt
→ We do this → Then this → Then that → Then this

    • Use python to code the critical feature of the system you have analysed and perform some testing to show that your system work.

→ All critical code must be done in python language
→ After the completion of the code testing must be done to show that the code run correctly
→ This is the implementation and the testing part

    • As well as the basic language feature you will be credited by the  GUI and the good design technique
      
→ Basic design and good GUI also help to get a good marking
